Style guide
===========

The style in which I write my code is the Google Style, as described here:

https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html

Exceptions:
- I will use tab indentation instead of space indentation (2.3.1).
- I will use a line break before an opening brace (4.1.2), except in a situation as in (4.1.3).
- I will use a +4 (or tab) indentation for blocks (4.2).
